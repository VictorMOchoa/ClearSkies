# ClearSkies
Android application that retrieves the current weather conditions for your current location. Leverages the Dark Sky Forecast API as our source for weather data and OkHttp as a tool to make HTTP GET requests. Uses JSON objects to parse the data that is retrieved and to be displayed in the app. You MUST have Location Services enabled to use this app.
